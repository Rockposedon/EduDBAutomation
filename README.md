# EduDBAutomation

**EduDBAutomation** is a Python-based automation project designed for efficiently managing vast amounts of user data within an online education platform. It comprises a data generation script and a MySQL database schema.


## Overview

EduDBAutomation is a versatile Python project designed for managing a database related to an online education platform. This project allows you to simulate real-world user interactions and efficiently handle large volumes of user data.

In the realm of online education, the need to populate and manage databases with user information, course data, payments, tests, and feedback is critical. EduDBAutomation simplifies this process by providing a script to generate synthetic data and populate your database, making it an ideal tool for educational startups, researchers, or developers working on education-related projects.

Whether you are testing your platform's performance, creating a demo environment, or conducting data analysis, EduDBAutomation helps streamline the process. It leverages the power of Python's Faker library to generate realistic, randomized data for your database, making it an invaluable asset for any online education project.

Anyone can take reference from this Python script to generate data and populate it according to their requirements.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (>=3.6) installed
- MySQL server installed
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone` :
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elearning-platform.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd EduDBAautomation
   ```
3. Install project dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This ensures that the required Python packages (Faker and MySQL Connector) are installed.

## Database Schema

Before running the data population script, you need to set up the database schema. You can create the necessary tables by importing the `E_learning_platform.sql` file provided in this repository.


### Steps to Create the Schema

1. **Access MySQL Command Line:** Open a terminal or command prompt and login to MySQL using your credentials:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p
   ```
2. Import the Schema: Navigate to the directory where the E_learning_platform.sql file is located and import it into the database:
    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < E_learning_platform.sql
    ```
3. Verify Tables: You can check if the tables were created successfully by listing the tables in the database:
     ```
    SHOW TABLES;
     ```

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the repository directory and execute the Python script to generate data:

    ```bash
    python E_learning_platform.py
    ```

This script automatically generates data and populates them with data using single Python scripts.

## Conclusion

EduDBAutomation is a Python and MySQL-based project designed to manage large-scale user data for an online education platform. It mimics real-world user interactions and efficiently handles vast volumes of data, making it an ideal solution for educational platforms seeking to streamline their data management processes. By following the steps in this guide, you can quickly set up the database schema, populate it with sample data, and explore the capabilities of this project.
